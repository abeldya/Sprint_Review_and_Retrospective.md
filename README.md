Essential Questions
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves gathering requirements through various methods such as interviews, surveys, and observation. By creating user stories, I can encapsulate these needs in a format that is easy to understand and prioritize. User stories help to focus on the end-user experience, ensuring that the development process aligns with what users truly want and need from the software.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is iterative and incremental, focusing on delivering small, functional pieces of software regularly. I aim to incorporate Agile processes such as Scrum, which emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. Practices like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives will be integral to my future development work, allowing for adaptive planning and quick responses to change.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team's goals, communicating effectively, and being open to feedback. It involves collaboration, where each member supports one another and shares knowledge. A good team member also takes responsibility for their tasks and is willing to help others, fostering a positive and productive team environment.
